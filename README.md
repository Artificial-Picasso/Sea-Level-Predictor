# 🌊 Sea Level Predictor

This project analyzes historical sea level data from 1880 to 2013 and uses linear regression to predict sea level rise through the year 2050. It was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp **Data Analysis with Python** certification.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and explore historical sea level data.
- Visualize the data using a scatter plot.
- Create two lines of best fit using linear regression:
  - One based on all available data (1880–2013).
  - One based on more recent data (2000–2013).
- Predict and visualize sea level rise through 2050.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** – Plotting and visualization
- **SciPy** – Linear regression model
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Code execution and presentation

## 📁 Files Included

- `sea_level_predictor.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis and plots.
- `epa-sea-level.csv` – Original dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
- `sea_level_plot.png` – Output graph showing:
  - Historical data points
  - Line of best fit from 1880–2050
  - Line of best fit from 2000–2050

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- The data shows a clear long-term upward trend in sea level.
- The recent trend suggests an acceleration in sea level rise.
- Linear models are used to project sea level rise up to the year 2050.
