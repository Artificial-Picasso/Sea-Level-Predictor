# 🌊 Sea Level Predictor

This project analyzes historical sea level data to predict future trends using linear regression. It's part of freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python Certification.

## 📈 Objectives

- Visualize historical sea level data from 1880 to 2013.
- Fit two lines of best fit:
  - One using all data (1880–2013).
  - Another using data from 2000 to 2013.
- Predict sea level rise through 2050.
- Save the resulting plot as `sea_level_plot.png`.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

## 📁 Dataset

- `epa-sea-level.csv`: Contains historical sea level data from 1880 to 2013.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to generate the plot.
4. The plot will be saved as `sea_level_plot.png`.

## 📊 Output
